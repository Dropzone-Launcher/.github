## 🎯 What You Get
📤 **Instant File Actions**: Drag files, text, or URLs to the grid to instantly upload to cloud services, copy to specific folders, share via email, or compress archives.
🚀 **Quick App & Script Launcher**: Assign applications, websites, or custom AppleScripts/Shell scripts to grid slots for one-click or drag-and-drop activation.

## About Dropzone
Dropzone is a unique productivity utility that reimagines how you interact with your computer by placing a powerful, customizable grid of actions at your fingertips. Activated by dragging any item to the edge of your screen, it eliminates the need to navigate through menus or open multiple applications for common tasks. It turns simple drag-and-drop into a powerful command interface, streamlining workflows that would normally involve several steps. Whether you're a developer needing to quickly upload a file to a server via SFTP, a writer managing research snippets, or anyone who frequently moves files between applications and locations, Dropzone saves clicks, reduces context switching, and brings a new level of efficiency to routine operations.

The true power of Dropzone lies in its extensibility and deep system integration. It comes pre-loaded with useful actions (called "zones") for services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Imgur, and FTP, but its built-in editor allows you to create custom actions tailored to your specific needs. You can write scripts that process files, create actions that interact with web APIs, or simply set up shortcuts to your most-used folders. By reducing complex workflows to a single drag-and-drop gesture, Dropzone acts as a productivity multiplier, helping you maintain focus and complete tasks faster. It's more than a launcher; it's a customizable automation hub that sits quietly on the edge of your screen, ready to spring into action.
